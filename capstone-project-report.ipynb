    "## Definition\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "For this project we will be creating an agent that can beat a hard coded CPU player in the classic Pong game directly from raw pixels. This is particularly challenge because the agent would have to read raw pixels and this create a large amount of states that has been liability of reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "The following tasks will have to be completed before this project can be called successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First we need to create a Pong simulator.\n",
    "- We will need to provided a hard-coded CPU player to use for our base comparisson.\n",
    "- We have to read the raw images from the UI.\n",
    "- Additionally, we will have to create a Deep Neural Network that can interpret and extrapolate efficiently for unseen game states.\n",
    "- Lastly, we need to implement the deep reinforcement learning agent to be able to be competitive against a hard coded CPU player.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "To be more precise we will have to come up with a rating for the agent. Simply, we will match the fully trained player against the hard-coded CPU, stopping the match when **the first player reaches 1000 points**. Our goal is to get to the 1000 points first, but hopefully we can keep the CPU player under 700 points."
