## Installation
The following dependencies have to be installed before running the code:

- [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html#download-and-setup)
- [OpenCV2](http://opencv.org/)
- [Shapely](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely)
- [Numpy](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)

*NOTE*: Most of this packages are straight forward to install using `pip` or `conda` but "OpenCV" in particular could be challenging. I highly recommend using your OS package management system to get it installed.

For example in Fedora, the following command would do just fine:

```
sudo dnf install opencv opencv-python
```
